# Eagle Data

Eagle Data is part of the EagleLibs collection.

## Building

Simply add data.c and data.h to your project and go.

You may compile to static libraries if you wish.

Note: Dynamic library building is not yet supported.

The documentation is written in MediaWiki format and is located in the
doc folder. There is a batch script for Windows users that will use
Pandoc to render a markdown version of the readme (for GitHub) and
render the main documentation as HTML.

## Usage

Please see the main documentation for the API reference.
