<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
int el_data_dsv_config_exclude_invalid_escape_sequence(el_data* dp);
</syntaxhighlight>

==Description==
Ignores invalid escape sequences during parsing.

==Parameters==
;el_data* dp
:A pointer to a valid el_data structure.

==Returns==
*On success: 1.
*On error: 0.

==Remarks==
Let's assume you have called this function. Your escape character is backslash, and for goodness knows what reason, you have escape codes, a, b and c to escape a, b and c. The following field: "\"\a\b\c\"" will be parsed as: "abc".

If you want this behaviour, you will have to explicitly call this function.

Calling this function multiple times is harmless but also pointless.
