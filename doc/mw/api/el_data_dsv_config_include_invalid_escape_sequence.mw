<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
int el_data_dsv_config_include_invalid_escape_sequence(el_data* dp);
</syntaxhighlight>

==Description==
Parses an invalid escape sequence as if unescaped, I.E. part of the data.

==Parameters==
;el_data* dp
:A pointer to a valid el_data structure.

==Returns==
*On success: 1.
*On error: 0.

==Remarks==
Let's assume you have called this function. Your escape character is backslash, and for goodness knows what reason, you have escape codes, a, b and c to escape a, b and c. The following field: "\"\a\b\c\"" will be parsed as: "\"abc\"".

It is normally not necessary to call this function, as this is the default behaviour. However it's always best to set these options explicitly.

Calling this function multiple times is harmless but also pointless.
