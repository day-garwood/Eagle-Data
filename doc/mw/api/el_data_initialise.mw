==Description==
Initialises the data system.

==Parameters==
;el_data* dp
:A pointer to an el_data structure.

==Returns==
*On success: 1.
*On error: 0.

==Remarks==
It is your responsibility to allocate memory for this structure and pass in a valid pointer to it. It doesn't matter whether it's allocated on the stack or the heap, just as long as the pointer points to accessible memory.

If the pointer is NULL, the function will fail.
