<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
char* el_data_dsv_get_field(el_data* dp, int field);
</syntaxhighlight>

==Description==
Gets the value of a specified field.

==Parameters==
;el_data* dp
:A pointer to a valid el_data structure.
;int field
:The zero-based ID of a field to retrieve.

==Returns==
*On success: A C-string with the parsed data for that field.
*On error: NULL.

==Remarks==
Data must first be parsed using el_data_dsv_parse_line before this function can be used.

Fields are parsed sequentially, so field 0 is the first field on the line, field 1 is the second, and so on.

If the field index is out of bounds, NULL is returned. Use el_data_dsv_count_fields to count the number of available fields.
